    <h2>Tips for making juices</h2>
    <hr>
    <br><br>

    <p><strong>Tips</strong>: 
       <strong>1. A formula for tasty juice</strong>
        Sweet: apples, pears, grapes, melons, pineapples, oranges, kiwis, mangoes, berries, grapes
        Tart: lemons, limes
        Roots: beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips
        Greens: Kale, spinach, lettuce, chard, arugula, mustard greens, beet greens, dandelion, sorrel, broccoli
        Herbs: Basil, parsley, cilantro, mint
        High-yield: Cucumbers, celery, fennel, tomatoes, melons
        Spicy: Ginger, hot peppers (use judiciously)

        <strong>2. Balance high-yield ingredients with high-potency ingredients.</strong>
        Cucumbers, celery, and apples are juicing tsunamis; but a little bit of ginger or mint goes a long way.
        Be aware of the behavior of each ingredient in the juicer (which will be immediately apparent when you've
        juiced it once), and try to maintain a reasonable balance between flexible, mellow ingredients and more intense ones.

       <strong>3. To peel or not to peel?</strong>
       In many cases, leaving the skin on the produce you juice is just fineâ€”even pineapple skin can roll just fine through most
       decent juicers. Especially if you're using the skin, do be sure to buy produce grown with organic practices when possible.
       A few exceptions, where you should peel:
       *Kiwis
       *Produce that's been waxed
       *Citrus fruits, if you want the pure taste of the juice without the skin's oil and the pith's bitterness
       *Any other ingredient where you're concerned the skin will affect the taste (for example, you might do a taste test with melons,
        though it's technically fine to juice the skins)
       *And, if you're visually astute or serving to a crowd, any peel that might negatively affect the color of the final juice
       
       <strong>4. Finally, consider color.</strong>
       The way food looks affects our perception of the way it tastes. The same applies at least equally to juices (and smoothies). 
       Don't make a grey juice or a brown one unless you have an opaque cup with a lid or a penchant for the grotesque. Pair intelligently.
       In a green juice, for example, apples and pears make better sweeteners than strawberries. If you're really stuck, just juice a beet.
       It's the ultimate color trump card and will override almost anything.
